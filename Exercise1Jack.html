    <p><i>Meet Jack</i></p>
    <p>This is Jack. He's an odd little boy that just got an empty box for his birthday. He may look happy, but he's a little disappointed. Now he'll have to put a few things in the bo</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Roller blades</li>
        <li>Magic tricks</li>
        <li>Anything Pokemon</li>
        <li>A motorized Lego set</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can get all this (and more) at an online toy store. Two very popular ones area <a href="http://www.toysrus.com/">toysrus.com</a>and <a href="http://www.etoys.com/">eToy</a>.</p>
